Bowerbird
=========

An R package for maintaining a local collection of sparkly data sets.

See [RAADTools](https://github.com/AustralianAntarcticDivision/raadtools) for reading, plotting, and manipulating these data.

Installing
----------

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("AustralianAntarcticDivision/bowerbird")
```

Bowerbird requires the third-party utility `wget` to recursively download files from data providers. `wget` is typically installed by default on Linux. On Windows you can use the `install_wget()` function to install it. Otherwise download `wget` yourself (e.g. from <https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/current/wget.exe>) and make sure it is on your path.

Usage
-----

### Configuration

Bowerbird must be configured to tell it which data sets to synchronise and where to save them on the local file system.

Build up a configuration by first defining global options such as the destination on your local file system:

``` r
cf <- bb_config(local_file_root="/your/data/directory")
```

Add data sources by choosing from those already defined in bowerbird:

``` r
library(magrittr)
cf <- cf %>% add(bb_sources("CERSAT SSM/I sea ice concentration"))
```

Or define your own data source:

``` r
my_source <- bb_source(
    name="GSHHG coastline data",
    description="A Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Geography Database",
    reference= "http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/pwessel/gshhg",
    citation="Wessel, P., and W. H. F. Smith, A Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical,
      High-resolution Shoreline Database, J. Geophys. Res., 101, 8741-8743, 1996",
    source_url="ftp://ftp.soest.hawaii.edu/gshhg/*",
    license="LGPL",
    comment="",
    method=quote(bb_wget),
    method_flags="--recursive --level=1 --accept=\"*bin*.zip,README.TXT\"",
    postprocess=quote(pp_unzip))

cf <- bb_config(local_file_root="/your/data/directory") %>%
    add(my_source)
```

### Synchronisation

Once the configuration has been defined, run the sync process:

``` r
bb_sync(cf)
```

Running the sync in parallel is likely to speed the process up considerably (unless your bandwidth is the limiting factor).

Note that a given data source may have several `source_url` values, each of which will have their own row in the configuration table (with the same data source `name` value). It is probably a good idea to avoid running these in within-data-source replicates in parallel, because they may overlap in terms of the parts of the remote site that they are mirroring. Thus, it's probably best to split the configuration up by data source `name` and run those subsets in parallel (untested code):

``` r
library(doFuture)
registerDoFuture()
plan(multiprocess)

foreach (i=unique(cf$name),.export=c("cf")) %dopar% {bb_sync(cf[cf$name==i,])}
```

Data sources
------------

Bowerbird comes with configurations for a range of data sources, mostly marine and Antarctic in nature. A summary of these is given below.

| Sea surface temperature | GHRSST Level 4 MUR Global Foundation SST v4.1                           | A Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Level 4 sea surface temperature analysis produced as a retrospective dataset (four day latency) at the JPL Physical Oceanography DAAC using wavelets as basis functions in an optimal interpolation approach on a global 0.011 degree grid. The version 4 Multiscale Ultrahigh Resolution (MUR) L4 analysis is based upon nighttime GHRSST L2P skin and subskin SST observations from several instruments including the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSRE), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the NASA Aqua and Terra platforms, the US Navy microwave WindSat radiometer and in situ SST observations from the NOAA iQuam project. The ice concentration data are from the archives at the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) High Latitude Processing Center and are also used for an improved SST parameterization for the high-latitudes.

IBCSO is a regional mapping project of the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO). The IBCSO Version 1.0 DBM has been compiled from all available bathymetric data collectively gathered by more than 30 institutions from 15 countries. These data include multibeam and single-beam echo soundings, digitized depths from nautical charts, regional bathymetric gridded compilations, and predicted bathymetry. Specific gridding techniques were applied to compile the DBM from the bathymetric data of different origin, spatial distribution, resolution, and quality. The IBCSO Version 1.0 DBM has a resolution of 500 x 500 m, based on a polar stereographic projection, and is publicly available together with a digital chart for printing from the project website (www.ibcso.org) and at <http://dx.doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.805736>.                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                        | <http://www.ibcso.org/>                                                                                                                                  |

| Topography              | RTOPO-1 Antarctic ice shelf topography                                  | Sub-ice shelf circulation and freezing/melting rates in ocean general circulation models depend critically on an accurate and consistent representation of cavity geometry. The goal of this work is to compile independent regional fields into a global data set. We use the S-2004 global 1-minute bathymetry as the backbone and add an improved version of the BEDMAP topography for an area that roughly coincides with the Antarctic continental shelf. Locations of the merging line have been carefully adjusted in order to get the best out of each data set. High-resolution gridded data for upper and lower ice surface topography and cavity geometry of the Amery, Fimbul, Filchner-Ronne, Larsen C and George VI Ice Shelves, and for Pine Island Glacier have been carefully merged into the ambient ice and ocean topographies. Multibeam survey data for bathymetry in the former Larsen B cavity and the southeastern Bellingshausen Sea have been obtained from the data centers of Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI), British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO), gridded, and again carefully merged into the existing bathymetry map.           |                                                                                                                        | <http://epic.awi.de/30738/>                                                                                                                              |
